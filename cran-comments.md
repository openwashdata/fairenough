## Version 1.0.0

Initial submission to CRAN.

## Resubmission (V1.0.1)

This is a resubmission. Following the suggestions of the reviewer I have:

* Moved CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to inst/*.
* Deleted the line "+ file LICENSE" and the corresponding file.
* Removed a potentially misleading term/word ("openwashdata") in DESCRIPTION.
